as we all know that react router enables routing to different pages without reloading the entire pages.
to implement react router we need to import react-router-dom lib
then <BrowserRouter> <Routes> <Route>....</Route> </Routes> </BrowserRouter>
<Route has 2 attributes one is path and another one is element - path defines the path of a component like /about, /contact whereas element denotes, which element should render on that particular path {home}, {about}. 

in html we use atag to navigate between pages likewise in react we link tag 
<Link to ="/about">About</Link>
<BrowserRouter> use pannum pothu url la link /about /contact ipdi dhn irukum
<hashRouter> use panna url la # irukum like #/about, #/contact ipdi

idhula vandhu normal path kuduthom let consider a scenario enaku post nu oru component iruku adhuku ulla i have different number of post i cant write a separate component for each of the component, instead i can create a common component for that adhuku we can use params router 
eg:
<Route path="/post/:id" element={<Post />} />
in this case id is a parameter which is passed to the Post component
we can create a component and can use useParams() hook to access it 
const component = () =>
{
    const {id} = useParams()
    return(
        <div> Post {id} </div>  based on the id respective component will be rendered
    )
}

we can also use nested routes
<Route path="/postpage">
    <Route index element = {<postpage/>}
    <Route path = ":id" element = {<Post/>}
</Route>  nested route /postpage is the parent route and the route "/postpage/:id" is nested inside in the parent route.
